# Open Video Editor 0.01a

* This is going to be the main executable for the application. 
  This is the video editing backend that will be managing the GUI. 
  That is, the GUI is secondary to this application. (That's not to say that the
  GUI is of secondary importance, but just that we shouldn't center development 
  around the GUI (which is expendable, while video editing functionality is not))

That is, none of the following require a GUI at all ... 

* I/O -- video/audio streams
  * Filters/transforms on streams ...
  * Format conversion
  * Network I/O & Broadcasting
  
* Clips
  * Filters/transforms on clips are more powerful than (and inclusive of) the transforms
    that we can do on streams. But clip transforms are bulkier and so for time-critical
    (e.g. live-streaming high-res video) you want to be able to have direct stream transforms
    also ... but some things that you can't do with a stream (crop/paste/rewind/etc.)

* Tracks/Sequences
  * Clip actually has at least one of these as an attribute (depending on how many tracks are in what the clip contains ...
  * The tracks in the timeline editor / sequencer (proper name?) area ..*

* ... and a lot of these things are already implemented elsewhere and we just have to plug them in (or write a clean/light version of them)

print "[Insert video editor here] :) ..."
