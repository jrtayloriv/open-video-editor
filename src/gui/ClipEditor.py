The ClipEditor is a panel that is docked in the MainWindow (by default)

The ClipEditor is where manipulate the arrangement of a particular Clip's VideoSegments, or apply a filter/effect to the Clip pipeline as a whole

* In the clip editor, clicking on the segments button will list all of the segments that are used in the clip, and will have an option that says "select in track editor" for each segment ... then you can zoom into the segment editing UI for that particular segment if you want (or you might just want to have it selected so you can move it around a bit)
