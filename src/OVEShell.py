#Open Video Editor - 0.01a

class OVEShell:
    'Interactive video editing shell. This is what is embedded in the GUI terminal widget'
    # * Start with basic Python interpreter that has access to the main GUI object and editing libs
    # * Later, design a simple domain-specific language that hides a lot of this complexity 
    #   from shell user (while keeping it available if needed)
