This directory is for IO modules ... basically everything between the video file (or other 
video stream -- e.g. network), and when we've finally managed to place that video segment 
into the clip structure

When clips are rendered/played, they are converted back into a stream for playback (i.e. 
IO modules also takes care of display on an output device (e.g. it might not be output to a screen, 
but rather broadcast on a network) ...

Video stream transform libs make requests here if they need to read/write raw data streams, convert file formats, etc..

* What about frame transforms? Yes, they go here. We would ask for a frame stream, and the filter would pull from that 
  and output the transformed frame into its output frame stream.
