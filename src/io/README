This directory is for IO Streams ... basically everything between the video file (or other 
video stream -- e.g. network), and when we've finally managed to place that video segment 
into the clip structure

When clips are rendered/played, they are converted back into a stream for playback (i.e. 
IO-Stream also takes care of display on an output device (e.g. it might not be output to a screen, 
but rather broadcast on a network) ...

Video stream transforms go here if they work on raw data streams. Clip manipulations are different.
(What about frame transforms?)
